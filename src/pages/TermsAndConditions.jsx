                        <p className="text">
                              Our team continuously negotiates offered products and services which are referred to in these Terms and Conditions as Deals with various suppliers of goods and services on behalf of our customers. The Deals are conditional on certain requirements being met and specific terms and conditions related to them, which will be described in relation to any specific Deal on our Website and on the corresponding Voucher. It is a condition (which we may at our discretion waive) that a certain minimum number of buyers, which we call the Tipping Point, offer to buy Vouchers in respect of the goods or services offered as part of the Deal becoming immediately available for purchase (hereafter known as Deal is live).
                              If the Tipping Point in relation to the Deal is reached, we shall - upon receipt of payment from you - issue a Voucher to you as per the Deal you paid for. If potential buyers of the Voucher in respect of a Deal are unable to complete their purchase of a Voucher due to various reasons including but not limited to the Deal not reaching the Tipping Point, and ensuring that all other mmdeals.com policies, including the Refunds and Shipping policies, are adhered to. mmdeals.com will ensure that all funds related to the incomplete purchase of a mmdeals.com Deal be not charged until the minimum number of purchases has been reached However, mmdeals.com has no obligation to ensure the continuation of the offer should the Tipping Point not be reached and no Vouchers for that deal will be issued.
                              mmdeals purchases at a discount from the regular price of the offer from merchants, for resale to buyers, the number of vouchers in respect of such offer as defined in mutually agreed voucher agreements. mmdeals also receives compensation for promoting, advertising, and marketing offers on behalf of partner merchants.

                              You should know that we are not the supplier of the goods and/or services that are offered as a mmdeals.com Deal. All of these products and/or services are delivered by the Vendor, on whose behalf we issue the Vouchers and who is ultimately responsible for ensuring the proper tracking of redeemed Vouchers by accessing the Vendor’s section of the web site. For each posted deal, the Vendor has agreed to ensure timely update of all redeemed Vouchers (within 24 hours of redemption) that were purchased from this Website, provided that the Tipping Point was reached. Failure to comply with the timely update clause by the Vendor will result in the Vendor encumbering all losses associated with ensuing illegitimate actions of Voucher holders.
